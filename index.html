<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

<p
    >We chose to use a line chart to visualize the change in usage over time, with
    the x-axis representing the years and the y-axis representing the total count 
    per year, as labeled on the visualization. We thought about using an 
    area chart but found that line charts have more interactivity such as a dropdown 
    menu and tooltip. 
</p>

<p>
    The line color changes every time you pick a new word from the dropdown menu 
    and has a smooth transition. This signifies the change in the graph according 
    to the new user interaction. 
    The words in the dropdown are sorted by the total count throughout all the 
    years (e.g. "love" is the overall most used word, "sweet" is the 100th). 
    When you start typing in the dropdown menu, it highlights to the best 
    matching word for easier selection, instead of scrolling through all the words. 
    These properties are all provided by the D3 sample code. 
</p>

<p>
    We chose a more stylish font called Montserrat. 
    The headers are given a different color to make them pop out 
    a little more. The background of the page is changed to an off-white 
    color so it's less straining to look at. We also added some padding to the 
    end of the page so the text doesn't end abruptly, right at the edge of the window. 
</p>

<h2>Development Process</h2>

<p>
    During dedicated class time we decided on a topic we would all like to work 
    on, and found a dataset from Kaggle.
</p>

<p>
    The first step to creating this data visualization is deciding what exactly
    we would like to present and cleaning the data correspondingly. We want to 
    know what are the most used words in song lyrics. Due to the size of the 
    dataset, we selected the top 100 most used words throughout all the years 
    and manually filtered out some meaningless words such as "oh", "ah", "la", 
    as well as curse words that are inappropriate for this school project. 
    We want to see the trends and differences over time, so we grouped them by year then summed the words 
    and their frequencies in the datset. We looked at the sample dataset given by the D3 website to see how 
    to organize the dataset better, and decided to 
    stack the rows into a way that D3 can easly read. The processed dataset.csv 
    have three columns: year, word, and count. The data cleaning process was done by Judel 
    and Gloria and took about 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
    We used the sample code for the linechart from 
    <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/line.html">
        the D3 website
    </a>
    , particularly the line chart with dropdown menu and the tooltip. We had some 
    problem making sure the tooltip would match up with the line as we pick 
    a different word from the dropdown menu. This part was mostly done by Dean 
    and Gloria, and took about 2 hours. 
</p>

<p>
    The style of the page, such as headings, fonts, and colors was done last 
    after the visualization. 
    This writeup was drafted by Gloria and finished collectively by all three 
    people in the group.
